# Media Player
A simple yet powerful media player (chrome extension) for browser built on top of video.js

Forked from https://github.com/inbasic/media-player. Updated video.js release and added new pluggins. 

Try it live (without installing the extension) at https://iamashwin99.github.io/media-player

tip: HTML5 Video Keyboard Shortcuts and Skip Silence are useful chrome extensions
